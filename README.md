# hivenseek
Quick and Dirty tool to scan for evidence of CIA's "hived" agent on Linux devices.

From the WikiLeaks 'Vault 7' disclosure, a system designated 'hive' is described.

Within the HIVE Developers Guide, a self-delete mechanism is documented to leave behind tell-tale signs of an active or abandoned implant of the hived agent.

This lightweight tool, 'hivenseek' was constructed to look for these signs on \*nix-like systems and report any such evidence.
